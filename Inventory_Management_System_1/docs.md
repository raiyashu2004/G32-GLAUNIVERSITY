This document provides detailed information about the Electron frontend of the CareEco Inventory Management System.

### Routing

*   **`Bills.jsx`**: This component displays a list of all past bills. It fetches the bill data from the backend and displays it in a table.
*   **`Dashboard.jsx`**: The main dashboard of the application. It provides an overview of the inventory, including a summary of products, purchases, and expiring items.
*   **`ExpiryNotification.jsx`**: This component displays a notification for items that are nearing their expiry date.
